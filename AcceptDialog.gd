# About Godot Engine¶
# A game engine is a complex tool and difficult to present in a few words. Here's 
# a quick synopsis, which you are free to reuse if you need a quick write-up about 
# Godot Engine:

# Godot Engine is a feature-packed, cross-platform game engine to create 2D and 3D 
# games from a unified interface. It provides a comprehensive set of common tools, 
# so that users can focus on making games without having to reinvent the wheel. 
# Games can be exported with one click to a number of platforms, including the 
# major desktop platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows), mobile platforms (Android, iOS), 
# as well as Web-based platforms and consoles.

# Godot is completely free and open source under the permissive MIT license. No 
# strings attached, no royalties, nothing. Users' games are theirs, down to the 
# last line of engine code. Godot's development is fully independent and 
# community-driven, empowering users to help shape their engine to match their 
# expectations. It is supported by the Godot Foundation not-for-profit.

# Organization of the documentation¶

# This documentation is organized into several sections:

# About contains this introduction as well as information about the engine, 
# its history, its licensing, authors, etc. It also contains the Frequently 
# asked questions.

# Getting Started contains all necessary information on using the engine to make 
# games. It starts with the Step by step tutorial which should be the entry point 
# for all new users. This is the best place to start if you're new!

# The Manual can be read or referenced as needed, in any order. It contains 
# feature-specific tutorials and documentation.

# Contributing gives information related to contributing to Godot, whether to 
# the core engine, documentation, demos or other parts. It describes how to 
# report bugs, how contributor workflows are organized, etc. It also contains 
# sections intended for advanced users and contributors, with information on 
# compiling the engine, contributing to the editor, or developing C++ modules.

# Community is dedicated to the life of Godot's community. It points to constious 
# community channels like the Godot Contributors Chat and Discord and contains 
# a list of recommended third-party tutorials and materials outside of this 
# documentation.

# Finally, the Class reference documents the full Godot API, also available 
# directly within the engine's script editor. You can find information on all 
# classes, functions, signals and so on here.

# In addition to this documentation, you may also want to take a look at the 
# constious Godot demo projects.

# The most advanced graphics backend, suited for desktop platforms only. Used by 
# default on desktop platforms.

#    Forward Mobile, running over Vulkan 1.0 (with optional Vulkan 1.1 and 1.2 features). 
# Less features, but renders simple scenes faster. Suited for mobile and desktop platforms. 
# Used by default on mobile platforms.

#    Compatibility, running over OpenGL 3.3 / OpenGL ES 3.0 / WebGL 2.0. The least advanced 
# graphics backend, suited for low-end desktop and mobile platforms. Used by default on 
# the web platform.

# 2D graphics¶

#    Sprite, polygon and line rendering.

#            High-level tools to draw lines and polygons such as Polygon2D and 
# Line2D, with support for texturing.

#    AnimatedSprite2D as a helper for creating animated sprites.

#    Parallax layers.

#            Pseudo-3D support including preview in the editor.

#    2D lighting with normal maps and specular maps.

#            Point (omni/spot) and directional 2D lights.

#            Hard or soft shadows (adjustable on a per-light basis).

#            Custom shaders can access a real-time SDF representation of the 
# 2D scene based on LightOccluder2D nodes, which can be used for improved 2D 
# lighting effects including 2D global illumination.

#    Font rendering using bitmaps, rasterization using FreeType or multi-channel 
# signed distance fields (MSDF).

#            Bitmap fonts can be exported using tools like BMFont, or imported 
# from images (for fixed-width fonts only).

#            Dynamic fonts support monochrome fonts as well as colored fonts 
# (e.g. for emoji). Supported formats are TTF, OTF, WOFF1 and WOFF2.

#            Dynamic fonts support optional font outlines with adjustable 
# width and color.

#            Dynamic fonts support constiable fonts and OpenType features 
# including ligatures.

#            Dynamic fonts support simulated bold and italic when the font 
# file lacks those styles.

#            Dynamic fonts support oversampling to keep fonts sharp at 
# higher resolutions.

#            Dynamic fonts support subpixel positioning to make fonts 
# crisper at low sizes.

#            Dynamic fonts support LCD subpixel optimizations to make fonts 
# even crisper at low sizes.

#            Signed distance field fonts can be scaled at any resolution without 
# requiring re-rasterization. Multi-channel usage makes SDF fonts scale down to 
# lower sizes better compared to monochrome SDF fonts.

#    GPU-based particles with support for custom particle shaders.

#    CPU-based particles.

#    Optional 2D HDR rendering for better glow capabilities.

# 2D tools¶

#    TileMaps for 2D tile-based level design.

#    Path2D node to represent a path in 2D space.
#            Can be drawn in the editor or generated procedurally.

#    Joints.
#    Areas to detect bodies entering or leaving it.

# 3D graphics¶

#     HDR rendering with sRGB.
#     Perspective, orthographic and frustum-offset cameras.

#     When using the Forward+ backend, a depth prepass is used to improve 
#     performance in complex scenes by reducing the cost of overdraw.
#     constiable rate shading on supported GPUs in Forward+ and Forward Mobile.

# Physically-based rendering (built-in material features):
#    Follows the Disney PBR model.

#    Supports Burley, Lambert, Lambert Wrap (half-Lambert) and Toon diffuse shading modes.
#    Supports Schlick-GGX, Toon and Disabled specular shading modes.
#    Uses a roughness-metallic workflow with support for ORM textures.

#   Uses horizon specular occlusion (Filament model) to improve material appearance.
#    Normal mapping.

#    Parallax/relief mapping with automatic level of detail based on distance.
#    Detail mapping for the albedo and normal maps.

#    Sub-surface scattering and transmittance.

#    Screen-space refraction with support for material roughness (resulting in 
# blurry refraction).

#    Proximity fade (soft particles) and distance fade.

#    Distance fade can use alpha blending or dithering to avoid going through 
# the transparent pipeline.

#    Dithering can be determined on a per-pixel or per-object basis.

#    Spot lights with adjustable cone angle and attenuation.
#    Specular, indirect light, and volumetric fog energy can be 
# adjusted on a per-light basis.

#    Adjustable light "size" for fake area lights (will also make shadows blurrier).
#    Optional distance fade system to fade distant lights and their shadows, improving performance.

#    When using the Forward+ backend (default on desktop), lights are rendered 
# with clustered forward optimizations to decrease their individual cost. 
# Clustered rendering also lifts any limits on the number of lights that can 
# be used on a mesh.

#    When using the Forward Mobile backend, up to 8 omni lights and 8 spot 
# lights can be displayed per mesh resource. Baked lighting can be used to 
# overcome this limit if needed.

#    OmniLight: Dual paraboloid (fast) or cubemap (slower but more accurate). Supports colored 
# projector textures in the form of panoramas.

#    SpotLight: Single texture. Supports colored projector textures.
#    Shadow normal offset bias and shadow pancaking to decrease the amount of visible shadow acne 
# and peter-panning.

#    PCSS-like shadow blur based on the light size and distance from the surface the shadow 
# is cast on.

# Rendering¶

# 3 rendering methods (running over 2 rendering drivers) are available:

# Forward+, running over Vulkan 1.0 (with optional Vulkan 1.1 and 1.2 features). 
# The most advanced graphics backend, suited for desktop platforms only. Used by 
# default on desktop platforms.

# Forward Mobile, running over Vulkan 1.0 (with optional Vulkan 1.1 and 1.2 
# features). Less features, but renders simple scenes faster. Suited for mobile 
# and desktop platforms. Used by default on mobile platforms.

# Compatibility, running over OpenGL 3.3 / OpenGL ES 3.0 / WebGL 2.0. The least 
# advanced graphics backend, suited for low-end desktop and mobile platforms. 
# Used by default on the web platform.
